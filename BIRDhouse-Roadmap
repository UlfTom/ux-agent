# BIRDhouse: Feature Roadmap & Lock-In Strategy

**Status:** Strategic Planning Phase  
**Last Updated:** November 17, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## EXECUTIVE PHILOSOPHY

> **The Core Principle:** Never sacrifice product quality for lock-in. Lock-in is the *outcome* of a great product, not the input.
>
> **Warning (Miro/Figma Syndrome):** If we optimize for lock-in over core functionality, we become a feature-shell living off brand momentum. Instead: Build an indispensable product, *then* add strategic lock-in that makes it impossible to leave.
>
> **Balance Strategy:** 
> - **60% of roadmap:** Core product excellence (Agent accuracy, Friction detection, Personas)
> - **30% of roadmap:** Integration & collaboration (API ecosystem, Team features)
> - **10% of roadmap:** Strategic lock-in (Data moats, Compliance, Community)

## ANTI-PATTERN GUARDRAILS (AVOIDING MIRO/FIGMA SYNDROME)

**Red Flags – Stop Immediately If You See These:**

| Red Flag | Action |
|----------|--------|
| "We're prioritizing integrations over Agent accuracy" | ⚠️ STOP. Accuracy is core. Integrations amplify it. |
| "The feature roadmap is 50% lock-in, 50% core" | ⚠️ STOP. Should be 70% core, 30% lock-in until Series A. |
| "We're building custom LLM fine-tuning before 100 customers" | ⚠️ STOP. Over-engineering. Focus on retention signal first. |
| "Let's add WhiteLabel version to close enterprise deals" | ⚠️ STOP. Feature creep before product-market fit. |
| "Community/events team is bigger than engineering" | ⚠️ STOP. If product sucks, no community can save you. |

1. **Review & Align:** Present this roadmap to co-founder(s) / investors. Confirm phase timing.
2. **Create Jira/Linear Board:** Translate epics → stories → tasks. Assign owners.
3. **Lock Phase 1 Scope:** No feature creep between weeks 1-12. Core only.
4. **Weekly Standup:** Use this roadmap as north star. Deviate only with explicit approval.
5. **Monthly Reviews:** Reassess based on customer feedback. Update roadmap accordingly.

---

**Last Note:** This roadmap is **not set in stone**. Customer feedback, competitive moves, or technical learnings will shift priorities. Review monthly. But the principle remains: **Core product excellence first. Lock-in second.**
